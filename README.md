# ArchFlow AI

ArchFlow AI empowers users to design, simulate, and document complex system architectures with the help of AI. Whether you prefer a manual drag-and-drop interface or a conversational AI assistant, ArchFlow AI streamlines the process from ideation to technical documentation.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Architecture Builder**
- **Natural Language Interface:** Describe your architecture in plain English.
- **Drag-and-Drop UI:** Visually build and edit diagrams with an intuitive interface.
- **Auto-Suggest Components:** Get intelligent suggestions for components (load balancer, DB, microservices, etc.) based on your input.

### 2. **Real-Time System Simulation**
- **Visualize Data Flow:** See how data and requests move through your system.
- **Component Interactions:** Highlight interactions, simulate latency, and identify bottlenecks.
- **Event-Driven Animations:** Watch system behavior unfold with real-time metrics and animations.

### 3. **AI Documentation Generator**
- **Automatic PRD & TRD:** Instantly generate Product Requirements Documents (PRD) and Technical Requirements Documents (TRD) from your architecture and chat history.
  - **PRD:** User-level requirements, goals, UX, and assumptions.
  - **TRD:** System architecture, data flow, APIs, and tech stack.
- **Customizable Templates:** Export documentation as PDF, Markdown, or Google Docs.

### 4. **Version Control & Collaboration**
- **Save & Share Designs:** Store and share your architecture diagrams.
- **Git-Style History:** Track changes and compare different versions.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** (Optional) Edit diagrams with your team in real time.

## üñ•Ô∏è Core Screens & User Workflow

ArchFlow AI is organized around several key screens that guide the user journey:

1. **Dashboard**
   - Central hub to initiate new projects, access existing designs, and view recent activity.
2. **Canvas UI**
   - Interactive diagramming interface for building and manipulating architecture diagrams.
3. **AI Assistant Panel**
   - Chat interface for interacting with the AI, requesting components, and generating documentation.
4. **Simulation Engine UI**
   - Visualizes data/request flow within the architecture and displays performance metrics.
5. **Documentation Panel**
   - Preview, edit, and export generated PRD and TRD documents.

## üß± System Architecture

### **Frontend (React-based)**
- **Dashboard:** Project management and quick access to recent work.
- **Canvas UI:**
  - Powered by D3.js or React Flow for diagramming.
  - Features snap-to-grid, connectors, groups, and annotations.
- **AI Assistant Panel:**
  - Chat interface powered by GPT (OpenAI API).
  - Suggests components, answers design questions, and generates docs.
- **Simulation Engine UI:**
  - Animates request/data flow.
  - Displays system health metrics, delays, and processing times.
- **Documentation Panel:**
  - Preview, edit, and export PRD/TRD documents.

### **Backend (Node.js/Express or Python FastAPI)**
- **Diagram Parser:** Converts visual diagrams into an internal DSL or JSON model.
- **Simulation Engine:**
  - Simulates events based on architecture DSL (inspired by object-storage backend).
  - Pushes real-time updates to the frontend (WebSockets).
- **AI Integration Layer:**
  - Processes diagrams and chat to generate PRD/TRD.
  - Uses OpenAI or a custom LLM pipeline.
- **Storage Layer:**
  - Stores user sessions, diagrams, simulation data, and version history (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).

## üîó Integration from Existing Repos

### **From `object-storage`**
- Use simulation logic to model read/write flows (S3-style services, microservices, DBs).
- Adapt storage-based events to simulate request handling in various architectures.

### **From `data-model-visual-app`**
- Reuse or extend the drag-and-drop diagramming interface.
- Add more node types: API Gateway, Auth Service, Worker, Queue, etc.
- Enable dynamic connector behavior (e.g., request-response, publish-subscribe).

## üìà Example User Workflow

1. **User opens ArchFlow AI and lands on the Dashboard.**
2. **User starts a new project or selects an existing one.**
3. **Canvas UI:** User builds the architecture diagram.
4. **AI Assistant Panel:** User interacts with the AI for suggestions and documentation.
5. **Simulation Engine UI:** User runs a simulation to visualize system behavior.
6. **Documentation Panel:** User previews, edits, and exports PRD & TRD documents.

## üìù Next Steps

The generated documentation can be used as input for tools like Cursor, which can then generate code and other artifacts automatically.
