# ArchFlow-AI

A comprehensive project that combines diagram creation, simulation, and documentation generation for system architectures.

## Core Structure

The application consists of 3 main tabs and an AI Assistant:

1. **Diagram Tab**
2. **Simulation Tab**
3. **Documentation Tab**
4. **AI Assistant** (always available)

## Features

### 1. Diagram Tab
- Embeds the existing "data-model-visual-app" design
- Three ways to create diagrams:
  - Manual creation
  - AI Assistant
  - JSON import
- Support for uploading/downloading workflows from data-model-visual-app
- Primary interface for creating system architectures
- Components can include:
  - Sequence numbers
  - Request/Response models
  - Data flow information
  - Component descriptions

### 2. Documentation Tab
- Contains three sub-tabs:
  - **PRD** (Product Requirements Document)
    - Project introduction and abstract
    - Project summary and goals
    - User stories and requirements
    - Business objectives
    - Success metrics
    - Stakeholder information
  - **TRD** (Technical Requirements Document)
    - System architecture details
    - Component specifications
    - Request/Response models
    - Data flow descriptions
    - Sequence information
    - Technical constraints
  - **Task List**
- Documentation is auto-generated based on:
  - Existing diagrams
  - User input
- Initial documentation helps in:
  - Understanding system requirements
  - Defining technical specifications
  - Planning implementation approach

### 3. Simulation Tab
- Two modes of operation:
  - **Empty State**: Only AI Assistant can help create simulation
  - **With Diagram**: Can generate simulation based on available information
- Support for multiple simulations within a single diagram
- Visualizes data flow and interactions between components
- **Purpose**: Acts as a Proof of Concept (POC) visualization
  - Demonstrates system behavior
  - Validates architecture design
  - Helps identify potential issues before actual implementation
- **Intelligent Gap Filling**:
  - Combines information from both Diagram and TRD
  - Examples:
    1. If diagram lacks sequence numbers but TRD has flow description:
       - AI adds sequence numbers to diagram
       - Updates TRD with component details
    2. If diagram has sequence but lacks request/response models:
       - AI adds request/response models from TRD to diagram
       - Completes missing information in both places

### 4. Project Editor UX Features
- Project Management:
  - Load/Save functionality for ".archflow" projects
- Documentation Tab:
  - Three sub-tabs (PRD, TRD, Task List)
- Generation Sequence:
  1. Diagram (manual/AI/JSON)
  2. Documentation (PRD & TRD)
  3. Simulation (POC visualization)
  4. Task List (actual implementation)
- **Intelligent Synchronization**:
  - Keeps Diagram and TRD in sync
  - Fills gaps in either component
  - Maintains consistency across all artifacts

## Example Workflow (Slack Real-Time Messaging)

1. **Initial Design Phase**
   - User creates diagram (manually/AI/JSON)
   - System generates initial PRD and TRD

2. **Documentation Phase**
   - PRD defines:
     - Project introduction
     - Business objectives
     - User requirements
     - Success metrics
   - TRD details:
     - Technical architecture
     - Component specifications
     - Data flow patterns
     - Request/Response models

3. **POC Phase**
   - Simulation combines information from:
     - Diagram sequence numbers
     - TRD flow descriptions
     - Request/Response models
   - Validates architecture design
   - Identifies potential issues

4. **Implementation Phase**
   - Task List is generated for actual project implementation
   - Includes:
     - Multiple backend services
     - API definitions
     - Routing layers
     - Full project implementation
   - Task List can be fed into AI code generators (like Cursor AI)

## Key Integration Points

- All components are interconnected
- AI Assistant helps at every step
- Documentation is automatically generated and updated
- Simulation serves as POC visualization
- Task List is the final output for actual implementation
- Intelligent gap-filling between Diagram and TRD
- PRD focuses on business and user requirements
